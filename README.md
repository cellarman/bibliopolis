# Why bibliopolis? 
bibliopolis came about because I saw a need in my church's children's library.

The REAL Bibliopolis! 
Currently the librarian has been "checking out" books to the kids by sticking a post-it on the book and taking a picture of the child with the book and then texting the picture to the parent. For example:

bibliopolis is a  way to checkout book to kids and autmotically notifying the parents of the due date of the book. bibliopolis also sends a reminder email the day before the book is due until the book is returned.

The idea was for the librarian AND the parent to be able to track which child had which book and when each were due and possibly even allow the parent to pay the fee with PayPal. However, what ended up coming out looks much different. Mostly because I did it in the MEAN stack and not with Ruby on Rails.
