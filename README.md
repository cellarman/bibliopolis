# Why bibliopolis? 
bibliopolis came about because I saw a need in my church's children's library.

The REAL Bibliopolis! 
Currently the librarian has been "checking out" books to the kids by sticking a post-it on the book and taking a picture of the child with the book and then texting the picture to the parent. For example:

bibliopolis is a  way to checkout book to kids and autmotically notifying the parents of the due date of the book. bibliopolis also sends a reminder email the day before the book is due until the book is returned.
